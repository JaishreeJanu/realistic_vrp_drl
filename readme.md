## ML-based Combinatorial Optimization for Solving the Realistic Vehicle Routing Problem

The work in this repository was done with collaboration of five project members. The project was developed as part of Research Project at University.

The folder names are quite intuitive. 
The project is ready to be run after setting up a python environment, activating virtual env and installing dependencies.
```python -m venv <python env_name> ```
```source <env_name>/bin/activate ```
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
